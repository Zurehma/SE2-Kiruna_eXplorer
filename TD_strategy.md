# Technical Debt Strategy

This document outlines our approach to managing and reducing technical debt across the project. By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to improve code quality, maintainability, and overall project health.

## 1. Quality Standards with SonarCloud

- Set a **minimum quality threshold** in SonarCloud for each code quality category.
  - **Target:** Achieve at least a **B rating** in all categories, including:
    - Reliability
    - Security
    - Maintainability
- Regularly monitor and address new issues flagged in SonarCloud to maintain or improve the projectâ€™s quality grade.

## 2. Code Review, Cleanup, and Improvement

- Allocate dedicated time in each sprint for:
  - **Thorough code reviews** to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
  - **Code cleanup** to remove unnecessary or redundant code.
  - **Minor improvements** that enhance readability, performance, or maintainability.

## 3. Sprint Planning for Technical Debt

- Include **technical debt management** as a regular part of sprint planning.
- Assign specific tasks and allocate hours for:
  - **Refactoring** existing code to align with updated standards.
  - **Resolving minor issues** that impact maintainability or performance.

## 4. Prioritization of High-Severity Issues

- Identify and track **high-severity technical debt issues** that pose a significant risk to the project.
- **Prioritize these issues** based on their impact on:
  - Project deadlines
  - System performance
  - Code maintainability
- Address critical issues in the **current or upcoming sprint** to mitigate risks promptly.
