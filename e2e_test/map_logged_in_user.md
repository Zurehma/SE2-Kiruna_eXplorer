### [ ] Map-Based Document Management Features

In this section, we verify that logged-in users can use the filtering options, perform map operations (zoom, center), and interact with documents assigned to specific locations.

6. Observe the changes on the map after each selection.

**Expected Results:**
- Only documents of the selected type are visible on the map.
- If "All" is selected, all available documents are displayed.
- The filtered documents should update dynamically according to the chosen type.

#### Test 2: Accessing Filtering Without Logging In (Not Logged-in User)
