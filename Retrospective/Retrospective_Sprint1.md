RETROSPECTIVE Sprint 1 (Team 13)
=====================================
﻿
The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:
﻿
- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)
﻿
## PROCESS MEASURES 
﻿
### Macro statistics
﻿
- Number of stories committed vs. done 
    - Committed: 4
    - Done: 
- Total points committed vs. done 
    - Committed: 9
    - Done: 
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
    - Planned: 
    - Done: 
﻿
**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed
﻿
> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 
﻿
### Detailed statistics
﻿
| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    25   |        |     50h       |                   |
| _KX1_  |    15   |   2    |     12h 30m      |              |
| _KX2_  |    15   |   3    |     11h 30m  |
| _KX3_  |    6    |   1    |     5h     |
| _KX4_  |    17   |   3    |     13h 20m | 
  
> story `#0` is for technical tasks, leave out story points (not applicable in this case)
﻿
- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Total estimation error ratio: sum of total hours spent / sum of total hours effort - 1
﻿
    $$\frac{\sum_i spent_{task_i}}{\sum_i estimation_{task_i}} - 1$$
    
- Absolute relative task estimation error: sum( abs( spent-task-i / estimation-task-i - 1))/n
﻿
    $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n \left| \frac{spent_{task_i}}{estimation_task_i}-1 \right| $$
  
## QUALITY MEASURES 
﻿
- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  
﻿
﻿
## ASSESSMENT
﻿
- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
﻿
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
﻿
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
﻿
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
﻿
  > Propose one or two
﻿
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
